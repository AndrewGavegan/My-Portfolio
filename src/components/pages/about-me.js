        through trial and error.<br /> From the outside the world of coding and software developement
        seemed like the perfect place to cultivate someone with that style of learning. <br /> So I acted
        on that thought and started creating landing pages for pretend companies, honing my HTML and CSS
        skills with all the free time I had in lockdowns.<br /> The pitfalls of error codes and the rushes
        of lightbulb moments that get things working has me hooked to coding like nothing else.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>What technical skills do I have?</h4> Comprehensive knowledge of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.Confident
        using and implementing third party and server-side APIâ€™s. More specific technologies that I love using include
        reactJS for the front end and nodeJS, expressJS, SQL, MongoDB and Mongoose for the back end.</div>
